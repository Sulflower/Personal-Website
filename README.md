This is my first attempt at making a website.

Used basic HTML and CSS to create a basic personal website about me.

- Contains buttons that prompts a file download, email prompt, and opening links in new tabs.
- One web page with different routes Home, About, Resume, and Contacts. Each route is done by hyperlinking.
- Sticky navbar that allows you to any of the routes listed above.
